We are a necessity for our squad, we are an absolute necessity, do you know why? Im gonna tell you why, if you have a squad of 4 people that are on that same level, right? 'Oh I'm the best, I'm the best', the team Isn't gonna mesh, team is gonna fall apart, I want you to know something, you are at the bottom of the leaderboard, because you are the anchor and you are the rock of that team, you are the person that someone can yell at, period."
